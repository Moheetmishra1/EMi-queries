    question:"What does MERN stack MEAN?",
    answer:`MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
	The MERN stack is a collection of technologies that help developers build robust and scalable web applications using JavaScript. The acronym “MERN” stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.`

        id:6,
        question:`What technologies are used in MERN stack?`,
        answer:`The MERN stack is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies that are used together to develop web applications. The stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. js. MongoDB is a highly scalable document database that makes it easy to store and retrieve data in JSON documents

        question:`What is the advantage of MERN?`,
        answer:`
        MERN is considered great for developing small applications, while MEAN is more suitable for larger projects. The MERN stack, using MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS, enhances the development process for various project ideas, making the user interface more dynamic.

        question:`What is the MERN stack for AI?`,
        answer:`
        MERN.AI is a full stack web application development platform which leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to simplify the development process. The primary feature of MERN.AI includes an AI chat feature that generates MERN stack applications and websites.

        question:`Will AI replace MERN stack developers?`,
        answer:`Will full-stack developers be replaced by AI? While AI may automate certain tasks, full-stack developers bring creativity and problem-solving skills essential for complex projects, making their role unlikely to be fully replaced by AI.

        id:5,
        question:`Which is better, AI or full-stack developer?`,
        answer:`Full-stack developers do both the front and back parts of making a website, using a bunch of skills. Even though AI can do some things automatically, human full-stack developers are valuable because they really get how both sides work, can solve problems, and make everything fit together. `
